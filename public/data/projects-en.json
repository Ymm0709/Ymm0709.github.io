    "introduction": "Designed and implemented a Java-based soccer card draw game with randomized mechanics, optimized code efficiency, and mastered core Java syntax and algorithmic thinking.",
    "description": "A Java-based console game where players randomly draw football player cards by entering commands. The game features 50 world-class football stars (both legendary and current players) with detailed information including position, preferred foot, and offensive/defensive ratings. Players can draw up to 100 cards and view their complete lineup at the end. I implemented the random draw system using Java's Random class, optimized code performance through different method approaches, and applied algorithms and data structures to ensure smooth functionality.",

    "introduction": "Reimagined Gomoku with a unique twist: trapped pieces can convert opponents. This project demonstrates my inventive thinking, strategic game design, ability to model complex game logic and robust object oriented programming skills.",
    "description": "A creative adaptation of the classic Gomoku game built with Java. Two players alternate placing black/white stones on a 15×15 grid, aiming to form an unbroken line of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The innovative feature: if you trap an opponent's stone between two of your stones, it gets captured and converts to your color. This unique mechanic adds strategic depth to the traditional gameplay. The project showcases advanced object-oriented programming principles, complex game state management, and interactive GUI implementation using Java Swing. As both game designer and programmer, I designed the game rules, implemented the core game logic, win condition detection, and the piece conversion system.",

    "description": "To create a comprehensive 360° panoramic view of our school, we aim to vividly showcase the campus environment through immersive visual experiences. This project will support virtual tours that allow students, parents, and visitors to explore the school from anywhere, gaining a realistic sense of its layout, facilities, and atmosphere. By integrating high-quality panoramic images and interactive navigation, we hope to enhance engagement, improve accessibility, and provide a more intuitive understanding of our campus culture and surroundings.",
